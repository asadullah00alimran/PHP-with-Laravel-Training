        <p>My name is Vlad Musienko, I'm a web designer.
            I love to draw and all that is connected with
            the design. In this area a long time ago and
            during this time I managed to create several
            successful projects used by people all over the
            world. </p>
        <p>
            I love the simplicity in the design of web sites.
            As I see it,people, it's like my work. Naturally do
            not want to rest on our laurels and will continue
            further studies to improve soybean skills,
            creating new interesting creative projects.
        </p>
